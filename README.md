## 🧰 Tech Stack

- `Next.js` (App Router)
- `React` + `TypeScript`
- `Prisma` + `PostgreSQL`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `@dnd-kit` (drag-and-drop)
- `Recharts` (dashboard charts)
- `zod` (input validation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Install dependencies

Use your preferred package manager (examples below):

```bash
bun install
```

### 2) Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add at least:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME"
```

Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and reachable from this URL.

### 3) Generate Prisma client

```bash
bun run prisma:generate
```

### 4) Apply schema to your database

```bash
bun run prisma:push
```

If you prefer migrations during development:

```bash
bun run prisma:migrate
```

### 5) Start development server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `dev` — run Next.js in development mode.
- `build` — create production build.
- `start` — run production server.

## 📝 Notes

- Realtime collaboration is currently refresh-based.
- The outbox/event pattern is in place for future worker/realtime integrations.
